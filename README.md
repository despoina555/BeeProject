(Bee) Book Embedding Editor is the fruit of effort to complete my diploma thesis and obtain a degree of National Technical University of Athens.

In my thesis I had to  analyze , design and develop a user friendly and easily expandable tool which will be used to support the  research in the field of book embeddings.It required to combine graph drawing and visualization techniques, programming skills as well as advanced mathematical concepts of graph theory and algorithms.
Top priority was given to write a well-structured and easily manageable code, which enables further extension and enrichment. The user can easily add more algorithms or features.

In this repo , you could find the source code and thesis PDF!
Enjoy :)
